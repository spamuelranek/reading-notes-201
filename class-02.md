# So, you are trying to be basic
## Got some HTML, CSS, and JavaScript under your belt

### HTML Text (pp.40-61)
![the cool person you are talking to](cool-cigarette.jpeg)
- _puffs a large cloud of almost purple smoke_
  - **cool person**: you know about structure right
    - Some. I have learned about some semantic tags. Like header, footer, and main.
  - **cool person**: they have the same things for text as well
- _deep pull and puff fills your vision_
  - **cool person**: `<b> and <i>` try to help the unintiated know what is important and both do this by either **bolding** or *italicized* 
- _even deeper pull and hold which they talk through_
  - **cool person**: `<sup> and <sub>` are rising items to super or sub script like that stuff even matters
    - It might matter depending on the content you are displaying and sharing. I imagine it would be very important for factual reporting of facts
- _finally lets cloud push through nostrils_
  - **cool person**: yeah whatever the semantic markup of text uses `<strong> and <em>` and it adds extra information in context.

### Basic CSS Stylings (pp.226-245)
- _they snub their almost finished cigarette out_
  - **cool person**: what do you know of style 
      - Do you mean my personal styling?
- _a smaller drag but a painful an long eye roll_
  - **cool person**: i of course mean about the page CSS
    - I only know the basics. That you can have "style" added three ways. Inline `<p style = color: ruby;>`, internal `<style></style>`, and external `<style rel=stylesheet href = "cssSource.css" type = "text/css" >`.
  - **cool person**: not bad these are the starting points but the actual structure of css code is just as important `p{ color: ruby}` the part outside the braces the *p* is the selector and the part inside is the decleration and it is made up of the property ie *color* and the value *ruby*
    - I can see the simple construction of the syntax. It targets a specific item and the describes what it would like to change and to by what value of change as well. Can it target any specific element?
  - **cool person**: of course it can grab elements in several different ways class id or even parent and child

### Basic JavaScript Instructions (pp.53-84)
- _they pull a tabacoo pouch out and rolling papers_
  - **cool person**: do you even know what you can make it do
    - Do you mean using functions
- _an eye roll as they start rolling a cigarette_
  - **cool person**: duf
    - Well I do know about variables. I know you have to declare them and that they are used to store values. Functions use these variable similarly as they are used in algebra. Oh and speaking of algebra the `=` is an operator and `==` actually means equal.
  - **cool person**: hmm you have some do you know what a string is or an array
    - I do know what a string is. It often is a word but it is an information that is no an interger/ number or a boolean. I know arrays from math class
  - **cool person**: an array is several pieces of data collected inside one variable `var pops = ["cola","orange","Dr"];` they are indexed starting at zero in this case `pops [0] = "cola"`

### Decisions and Loops (pp.145-162)
- _they set the cigarette back in its filter_
  - **cool person**:what kind of functions do you already know how to call
    - I know how to write conditional statements using `if and else`. You must evaluate an conditional expression and then a conditional statement about what to do for the outcomes of the evaluation. In addition to comparison operators (`==,!=,!==,<,>`)(equal, not equal, strict not equal, less than, greater than ) there are also logical operators(`&&,||,!`) (and, or, not).
